### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name's Alex and I work at @Scrimba where I host [The Scrimba Podcast](https://scrimba.com/podcast)
- On the show, I interview recently-hired Juniors to learn how they got a job (and you can too!) 
- Before all that I was a Freelance Full-Stack Web Developer and Developer Advocate
- You can still find some of my projects and contributions here on GitHub!
